## Road Fatality Statistics for Australian States 1989-2023

Sadly, Australia's Road's claim a large number of lives every year. In this analysis, we look at the road tolls across the last 40 years, looking to understand how things have changed as a result of various factors.

## Questions
1)	What has the general trend for road fatalities in Australia been like over the last 40 years?

2)	Anova test : Was the variance in Statesâ€™ road fatalities month by month during covid lockdown following a similar variance?

3)	Specifically in the last four years, how have various factors (age, speed limits, time of day or day of week, remoteness of the region, or type of road) impacted the number of accidents?

4)	Specifically in Victoria, did the introduction of booze buses and mobile speed radars have a significant impact on road fatalities?

5)	In 1999, Victoria rewrote various road regulations. Did this change have a significant impact on road fatalities? How did this compare to NSW across the same period?
